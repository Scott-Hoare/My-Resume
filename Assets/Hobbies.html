    <h2>Cars</h2>
    <p>
        Cars have always had a way of drawing me towards them, from the design to the sounds I fell in love with them and 
        continue to enjoy learning how they work and moddifying my own.

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
        Music has been a part of my life since I was a little kid, I grew up hearing everything from B.B.king 
        to Queen, I prefer older music but my favorite genre is the blues as it has a unique calming soundthat helps me focus 
        whilst working.
