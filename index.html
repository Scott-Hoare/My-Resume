        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
            I have learned a few skills throughout my life and each has taught me different lessons that help me every day.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Guitar
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Guitar has taught me a few things but the most valuble of them is perseverance, 
                        Every note you have to play requires a precise movement and the only way to gain 
                        that precision is through relentless practice. This is the same attitude I bring 
                        to my coding, as practice is the base of any skill.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Swimming
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Swimming has taught me that no matter the situation staying calm is the best thing to 
                        do, this helps me remain level headed and work through any problems that I encounter 
                        instead of annoyed and giving up.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I had to gain organisational skills during my A-Levels and during university to maintain good grades 
                        make sure that my assignments were handed in on time and still have a social life
